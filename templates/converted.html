<h1>Image preview</h1>
This is a preview of what your completed project would look like! If you're not
satisfied with something you see, scroll all the way bottom and you can tweak
your parameters until you are.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename=in_fname) }}" class="b-and-a" /></td>
        <td><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename=out_fname) }}" class="b-and-a" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Before</td>
        <td>After</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
These are instructions for how to work your projectâ€”rows are displayed in
ascending order from top to bottom, and each row gives instructions for working
from left to right. Colors are indexed by letters in these instructions, and you
can scroll to the very bottom to see which letters correspond to which colors.

<div id="instructions">{{ instructions | safe }}</div>
<h1>Edit parameters</h1>
Here you can tweak the parameters if you want to adjust your gauge, image size,
or number of colors to use. If you're not satisfied with the resolution of your
project, you'll either want to increase the size of the image, or you can swatch
with a smaller gauge needle. If you want to try with a new picture, you can go
<a href="{{ url_for('upload') }}">back to the upload page</a>.
